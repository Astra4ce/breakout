Overview
--------

This simple breakout clone game was created by Julia Gurando to experiment with python
programming and specifically game engine pygame.


Virtual Environment venv
------------------------

To create virtual environment:

    cd breakout
    python3 -m venv venv

If python3 is not installed on your system you may have to first install it.
If your system does have python version 3 but its not called python3 specify python interpreter name / path explicitly
when running above command.

Once virtual environment has been created, you will have venv subdirectory created under breakout.
Before it can be used it has to be activated:

To activate virtual environment from command line:

on Windows run the following batch file from command line:

    venv\Scripts\activate.bat

On linux or mac run the following command from terminal:

    source venv/bin/activate

To deactivate virtual environment run "deactivate" command or just close the command line / terminal window.

Once environment was activated we should install pygame which can be done using pip:

    pip install pygame

This command will install pygame inside python virtual environment will be made to the computer.

To run the game just execute:

    cd breakout
    python main.py
