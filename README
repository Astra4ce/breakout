Overview
--------

This simple breakout clone game was created by Julia Gurando to experiment with python
programming and specifically game engine pygame.

This project is on github: https://github.com/Astra4ce/breakout

Virtual Environment venv
------------------------

To create virtual environment:

    cd breakout
    python3 -m venv venv

If python3 is not installed on your system you may have to first install it.
If your system does have python version 3 or later but its not called python3 - specify python
interpreter name / path explicitly when running the above command.

Once virtual environment has been created, you will have venv subdirectory created under breakout.
Before it can be used it has to be activated:

To activate virtual environment from command line:

on Windows run the following batch file from command line:

    venv\Scripts\activate.bat

On linux or mac run the following command from terminal:

    source venv/bin/activate

To deactivate virtual environment run "deactivate" command or just close the command line / terminal window.

Once environment was activated we should install pygame inside it which can be done using pip:

    pip install pygame

Running The Game
----------------

To run the game just execute from command line:

    cd breakout
    python main.py
